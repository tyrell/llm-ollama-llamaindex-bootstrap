python main.py "What's a Wine Glasses Goblets?"

Answer:
A Wine Glasses Goblets is a set of wine glasses with goblet-style bowls, designed for holding and drinking wine. These glasses typically have a large, round bowl that narrows towards the top, providing a generous surface area for swirling and sniffing the wine's aromas. They are often used for red wines, as their shape allows for better aeration of the wine, which can enhance its flavors and aromas.
